# ‚òÄÔ∏è Solar Energy Prediction with Machine Learning

Welcome to the **Solar Energy Prediction** repository! This project leverages machine learning techniques to forecast solar energy output based on historical data. The analysis is carried out using Python and presented in a Jupyter Notebook.

## üìñ Introduction

- **Solar energy prediction** is essential for optimizing energy production and managing resources effectively.
- This project aims to predict solar energy output by analyzing historical weather and solar data using advanced machine learning models.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the solar energy dataset for more accurate model predictions.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implement various regression models to forecast solar energy output, such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Evaluate model accuracy using metrics like MAE, MSE, and R¬≤.
- **Visualization**: Generate visualizations to better understand data trends and predictions, including time series plots and feature importance charts.

### How to Run the Project:

1. **Ensure Dependencies Are Installed**:
   Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You can do this by creating a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:
   
Then, install the dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**: 
After the dependencies are installed, you can run the Jupyter Notebook by navigating to the project directory and running:
```
jupyter notebook main.ipynb

```
3. **Access the Notebook**: 
Open your browser and go to the URL:
```
http://localhost:8888/notebooks/main.ipynb
```


## üìä Dataset Information

The analysis is based on the **Solar Prediction Dataset** provided in this repository. It contains various features like temperature, humidity, solar radiation, and wind speed, which are used to predict solar energy output. 

### Important:
- **Dataset Location**: Ensure that the `SolarPrediction.csv` file is in the same directory as your scripts and notebooks to allow seamless data loading.

The dataset consists of historical weather and solar data, recorded at hourly intervals. The goal is to predict solar energy output for a given set of weather conditions.

## üöÄ Usage

- **Data Exploration**: Start by exploring the data in the notebook to understand the features and relationships.
- **Model Training**: Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess the data and train machine learning models.
- **Prediction**: Use the trained models to predict solar energy output for new data and evaluate model performance.
- **Model Tuning**: Use hyperparameter tuning techniques such as GridSearchCV to improve model accuracy.

## üìà Results and Visuals

Here are some key insights and visualizations generated by the analysis:

- **Solar Energy Output Prediction**: Time series plots that show the predicted solar energy output versus the actual energy output.
- **Feature Correlation Analysis**: Visualizations showing the correlation between various features (temperature, humidity, radiation) and solar energy output.
- **Model Comparison**: Bar plots comparing the performance of different machine learning models using evaluation metrics (MAE, MSE, R¬≤).
